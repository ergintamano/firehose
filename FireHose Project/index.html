		<p class="bio"> 
			Ergin Tamano is a web developer specializing in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and RUBY. He previously worked in customer service for 6 years and decided to shift careers after realizing that he was no longer happy where he was professionally. 
		</p>
		<p class="bio">
			He took sometime off work in July 2017 to really think about what he wanted to do and find a career path that he would be happy doing. After weeks and weeks of research, he stumbled upon coding. After watching Youtube videos of vloggers who found success through coding, he was convinced this was the answer to his prayers. It made sense. Technology affects us all in every aspect of our life. It was the only way forward!!!
